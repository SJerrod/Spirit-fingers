* (10:30am) Fixing movement to players view direction
* (10:45am) Player can move and movements are based off of camera direction
* (11:00am) Add player collider to account for player moving into or onto objects 
* (11:30am) Player can interact with objects although cannot physically grab yet, only move push
* (12:00pm) Still working to make objects grabable  
* (1:00pm)  Grabbing objects is turning out to me far harder then anticipated
* (1:30pm)  Still trying to Grab
