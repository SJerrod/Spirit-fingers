## 3.5.2021
* (8:00am)  Add Project Proposal
* (8:30am)  Progress was not saved properly Rebuild required
* (9:00am)  Rebuilding project
* (9:30am)  Rebuilding 
* (10:00am) Attempt to add movement
* [Hand Tracking](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/articles/Skeleton-Input.html)
* (10:30am) Fixing movement to players view direction
* (10:45am) Player can move and movements are based off of camera direction
* (11:00am) Add player collider to account for player moving into or onto objects 
* (11:30am) Player can interact with objects although cannot physically grab yet, only move push
* (12:00pm) Still working to make objects grabable  
* (1:00pm)  Grabbing objects is turning out to me far harder then anticipated
* (1:30pm)  Still trying to Grab
* (2:00pm)  Still trying to Grab
* (2:30pm)  Still trying to Grab
* (3:00pm)  Still trying to Grab
* (3:30pm)  Importing assets to VSC from Unity
* (4:00pm)  Eureka I can grab objects now...but velocity defaults to zero on throw
* (4:30pm)  Fixing grab errors and buggy dancing objects
* (5:00pm)  Punch the clock...and not just virtually.

## 3.8.2021
* (8:00am)  Stand-up
* (8:30am)  Stand-up
* (9:00am)  Stand-up
* (9:30am)  Hands not showing up, attempt to restart and fix
* (10:00am) Hands back up but have no texture/ material
* (10:30am) Messing with shaders to get hands to show and not say unloaded assets
* (11:00am) Working to add Destructable props, Downloading blender
* (11:30am) Downloaded magicaVoxel for voxel rendered models
* (12:00pm) Lunch/ building a voxel Model
* (1:00pm)  Voxel Model rendered in Unity
* (1:30pm)  No Luck getting collision detection from hands on model
* (2:00pm)  Switched to blender following basic model tutorial to create object
* [Blender import](https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-import-blender-models-into-unity-your-one-stop-guide/)
* (2:30pm)  Using Cell Fracture add-on to auto fracture a model
* [Cell Fracture](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/object/cell_fracture.html)
* (3:00pm)  Continue looking into Object Collision
* (3:30pm)  Collision detection success and it replaced the object with a broken object
* (4:00pm)  Career services
* (4:30pm)  Add force mechanic to break script to throw objects
* (5:00pm)  Pizza Time!!!

## 3.9.2021
* (8:00am)  Looking more into blender model building
* (8:30am)  Crafting tower Asset
* (9:00am)  Adding tower to unity with fractured and un fractured versions
* (9:30am)  Fracturing is tolling my computer
* (10:00am) Restart
* (10:30am) Objects are fracturing and  rotating 90 degrees attempting to stop that behavior
* (11:00am) Still trying to solve orientation problem
* (11:30am) Orientation stems down z and y axis being reversed in both programs
* (12:00pm) Object breaks as desired
* (1:00pm)  Add to Movement and more blender assets
* (1:30pm)  Trying to make hand collision detection trigger fracturing
* (2:00pm)  Add Collider to hands to enable punch damage
* (2:30pm)  Side effect of collider now initial interaction causes damage
* (3:00pm)  No luck resolving initial hit on contact
* (3:30pm)  Modeled another building to add to scene
* (4:00pm)  Discovered how to turn fractured object pieces into new throwables/ but on initial destruction they cause a chain reaction
* (4:30pm)  Moved files from unity folder to project folder
* (5:00pm)  Why have I barely eaten or drank today

## 3.10.2021
* (8:00am)  Today maybe look into better movement and grabbing/ interaction
* (8:30am)  Just looking through resources
* (9:00am)  Create new controller input 
* (9:30am)  Attempt to script in new input
* (10:00am) Cant get input to register
* (10:30am) Still no luck getting sprint input
* (11:00am) Moved on to possibly add jumping
* (11:30am) Still no jump
* (12:00pm) Lunch time
* (1:00pm)  Head banging on keys
* (1:30pm)  No Progress
* (2:00pm)  No Progress
* (2:30pm)  Today has been an uphill battle and Im on a skateboard :-/
* (3:00pm)  FINALLY GOT SPRINT WORKING, I was dancing around what I needed all day
